# Participant Handout (TTX)

## What you have
- DLP alerts
- Repository audit logs
- Identity logs (SSO/VPN/MFA)
- Proxy/egress logs
- Endpoint EDR telemetry
- HR travel record snippets (later inject)

## Your outputs
By the end, produce:
1. A decision log (key choices and why)
2. A timeline (identity → collection → staging → exfil)
3. A scope ledger (what objects, how much, where to)
4. An executive brief (1 page)
5. 5 remediation actions mapped to ATT&CK techniques

## Ground rules
- Use facts and confidence levels
- Coordinate through the Incident Commander
