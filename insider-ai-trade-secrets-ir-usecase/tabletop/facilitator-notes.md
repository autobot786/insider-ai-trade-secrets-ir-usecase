# Facilitator Notes

## Success looks like
- Participants identify that this is a likely insider misuse scenario within 20–30 minutes
- They preserve evidence before taking disruptive actions
- They choose containment consistent with risk and policy
- HR/legal are engaged early, and communications remain controlled
- They produce a credible scope ledger and executive update

## Common pitfalls to watch for
- Over-focusing on “how did they get in?” (they’re a valid user)
- Disabling the account too early (destroying evidence or triggering evasive behavior)
- Failing to confirm whether any data actually left the boundary
- Informal comms that tip off the subject

## Optional “curveballs”
- A security researcher emails claiming they have your confidential doc
- The subject’s manager insists they’re “just working hard”
- An OAuth token to a personal cloud app is discovered on a shared build machine
