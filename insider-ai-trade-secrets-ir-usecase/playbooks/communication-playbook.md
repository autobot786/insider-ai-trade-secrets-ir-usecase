# Playbook: Communications for Insider Threat Incidents

## Objectives
- Protect investigation integrity (avoid tipping off the subject prematurely)
- Ensure legal/HR compliance and proper documentation
- Provide executives with clear, non-speculative updates

## Principles
- **Need-to-know** distribution
- Use **facts + confidence level**, avoid assumptions about intent early
- Preserve attorney-client privilege where applicable
- Do not conduct “shadow HR” actions outside HR/legal process

## Notification order (typical)
1. IR Lead / SOC Manager
2. Legal Counsel
3. HR Business Partner
4. Exec Sponsor (CISO or delegate)
5. Comms/PR (only if external disclosure is possible)

## What not to do
- Don’t message the subject about the investigation
- Don’t ask colleagues to “watch” the subject casually
- Don’t threaten termination or make accusations in writing outside HR/legal

## Standard messages (templates)
See `templates/`:
- Exec brief: `templates/exec-brief-template.md`
- Legal hold: `templates/legal-hold-template.md`
- IR ticket: `templates/ir-ticket-template.md`
