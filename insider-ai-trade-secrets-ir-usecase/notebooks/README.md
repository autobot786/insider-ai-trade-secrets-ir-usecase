# Notebooks

These notebooks are designed for training and tabletop support using **synthetic** telemetry.

- `01_access_baselining.ipynb` – find abnormal doc/code repository access
- `02_dlp_event_analysis.ipynb` – analyze DLP incidents and correlate with proxy
- `03_geo_anomaly_vpn.ipynb` – detect impossible travel and VPN masking
- `04_data_exfil_correlation.ipynb` – build a staging→exfil timeline

Data lives in `notebooks/data/` (CSV).
