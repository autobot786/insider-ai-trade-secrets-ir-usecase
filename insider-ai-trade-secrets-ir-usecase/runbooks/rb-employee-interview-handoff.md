# Runbook: HR/Legal Handoff for Employee Action & Interview Support

## Goal
Support HR/Legal with a fact-based packet while maintaining investigation integrity.

## Steps

1) Provide a **facts-only** summary:
- what was observed (timestamps, systems, actions)
- what is confirmed vs suspected (confidence levels)
- what data classes were involved

2) Provide evidence references:
- key log excerpts / event IDs
- DLP packets
- scope ledger snapshots

3) Provide suggested interview topics (HR-led):
- explanation for off-hours bulk access and exports
- explanation for external upload attempts
- disclosure of external affiliations/conflicts
- device usage and storage locations

4) Coordinate device retrieval & access revocation timing:
- minimize risk of tipping off before preservation is complete

## Outputs
- HR/Legal packet delivered
- Approved plan for interview + device retrieval + access changes
