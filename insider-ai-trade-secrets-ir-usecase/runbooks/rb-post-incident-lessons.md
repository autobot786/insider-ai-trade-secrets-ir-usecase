# Runbook: Post-Incident Review (Insider Threat)

## Steps
1) Timeline & scope validation
2) Root-cause analysis:
   - access model gaps (least privilege, JIT)
   - detection gaps (missing telemetry, weak correlation)
   - governance gaps (external affiliations, ethics reporting)
3) Control improvements:
   - DLP hard-block for crown jewels
   - peer-group baselines and anomaly detection
   - restrictions on repo export and bulk operations
4) Update playbooks/runbooks and train stakeholders
5) Track remediation to closure with owners and dates

## Outputs
- PIR document + action register
- Updated detections and thresholds
- Training notes / awareness improvements
